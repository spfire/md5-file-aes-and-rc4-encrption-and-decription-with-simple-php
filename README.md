The code provided require you to build a database for user registration.
Anyway, it's not a good code since only file from your local folder can be encrypted.

first thing to do is to create a database named project.
then create a table named users with user_id (primary key), username and password inside it (just make it varchar).

then reqister with localhost/md5-file-aes-and-rc4-encrption-and-decription-with-simple-php/login.php
that's all

btw, the aes and rc4 only encrypt the plaintext on user input since.
